## Ham Cam : Average RGB

The [previous example](../hcc_01_extract_jpegs/) saved a JPEG image for every frame in the Ham Cam daily video.

This example computes a frame property, in this case the average RGB, and saved the values to a file.

The average RGB is not a partcularly fancy measure, but it will be used in another example.

The above plot shows the daily video as an XY scatter plot where the Y-axis is time or frame number and the Y-axis is the average frame RGB.
