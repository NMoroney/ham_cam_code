# Ham Cam Code

The [Ham Cams](https://mthamilton.ucolick.org/hamcam/) at the top of [Mount Hamilton, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hamilton_(California)) are probably my all time favorite webcams.

This repository is a collection of code for processing and analyzing the Ham Cam vidoes. 

All of the examples use [OpenCV](https://github.com/NMoroney/macos-command_line_examples/tree/main/examples/mc_02_opencv) and for some of the examples, additional libraries are required.
